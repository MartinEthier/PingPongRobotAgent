# PingPongRobotAgent
This repository is a project involving simulating and training a robotic arm to play the game of ping pong. The simulator is created using the PyBullet environment and a reinforcement learning agent is trained with OpenAI's gym library.

## Simulation
The simulation is a gym environment built using PyBullet. 

## Agent
The agent was trained with the use of PyTorch and the gym environment. The deep reinforcement learning model used is proximal policy optimization (PPO).
